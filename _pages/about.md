My name is René Shahmohamadloo and I am a both a [Liber Ero Postdoctoral Fellow](https://liberero.ca) and [NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pd-np/pdf-bp_eng.asp) at Washington State University. My mentorship team includes [Seth Rudman](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=tkLbIiAAAAAJ&hl=en) and [John Fryxell](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=mq20LGsAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research focuses on understanding the adaptive responses of organisms to human-altered environments, integrating toxicological, population ecology, and evolutionary mechanisms to address pressing questions in organismal biology and conservation. Having received my PhD training in toxicology, I've found dedicating my postdoc to expanding my knowledge in evolutionary biology and genomics to be truly riveting.

My career goal is to advance scientific understanding of the interplays between evolutionary biology and toxicology and to leverage this knowledge to address emerging threats and persistent conservation challenges for biodiversity. From combating harmful algal blooms underwater to addresing pesticide resistance evolution on land, my approach is inherently interdisciplinary. It necessitates a holistic understanding of ecological, evolutionary, and biochemical dynamics. Moreover, I am committed to driving actionable regulatory change, shaping policies that safeguard ecosystems and promote the well-being of both humans and wildlife.

Let's work together to advance scientific understanding and address conservation challenges with expertise and collaboration.
